Instructions: 

As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s homework invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

As I am behind in the course, I was only able to do some html. I am currently studying CSS and more Javascript in order to be able to complete all assignments. This HTML was difficult for me and I had to ask for some help, however after doing it things seem to make more sense after. I plan to redo this assingment in the future as well.
